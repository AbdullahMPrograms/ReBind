# ReBind

CURRENT ISSUES:

TO DO LATER:
- Make either extension or code modifications to make sure all keybinds sent to youtube tab go only to the video player
- OPTIMIZATION/Clean-Up
- Maybe update LoopMicVolume to find micid via name then set volume
- Maybe modular sections of the code via cfg files? dont know if this is possible
- Make it so that you can send youtube hotkeys even when youtube is not the focused tab
- Make it so that you can skip forward and back when edge is focused
- Universal Audio Keybinds
- GUI
