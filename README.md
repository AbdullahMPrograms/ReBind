# ReBind Beta

CURRENT ISSUES:
YouTube keybinds dont work because stremio is hardcoded as the first active program --investigating

Fix not being able to use stremio keybinds when youtube is open - possibly related to static #IF WinExist design principle


TO DO LATER:
Make it so that you can send youtube hotkeys even when youtube is not the focused tab

Make it so that you can skip forward and back when edge is focused
