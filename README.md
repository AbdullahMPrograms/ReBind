# ReBind Beta

CURRENT ISSUES:
Fix not being able to use stremio keybinds when youtube is open - possibly related to static #IF WinExist design principle
-- Possibly fixed needs testing

TO DO LATER:
- Make it so that you can send youtube hotkeys even when youtube is not the focused tab
- Make it so that you can skip forward and back when edge is focused
- Universal Audio Keybinds
