# ReBind Beta

CURRENT ISSUES:
YouTube keybinds dont work because stremio is hardcoded as the first active program --investigating


Maybe make it so that you can use alt delete to cycle through the windows at any time and then later make it so that it only cycles through the windows that open later?
- it still sends all inputs to the first window that was opened

Error when switching to second program if its not open in the freefly method 
-fix later

Make it so that you can send youtube hotkeys even when youtube is not the focused tab

Make it so that you can skip forward and back when edge is focused
