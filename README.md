# ReBind Beta

CURRENT ISSUES:

TO DO:
- Add switching for if more then one youtube tab exists (same keybind as regular switching)
- make a 50% (or lower) opacity gui of the app icon when sending a keystroke (if more then one window is open) 
  - for instance if volume is sent to yt the youtube icon will appear at the top left the of the window and will be lightly visible (makes it easier to know where keys are being sent for multiple program sends)
- Universal Audio Keybinds (combine python + ahk via wrapper/via cfg)

TO DO LATER:
- Make either extension or code modifications to make sure all keybinds sent to youtube tab go only to the video player (use selenium for python)
- Make it so that you can send youtube hotkeys even when youtube is not the focused tab (use selenium for python)
- Make it so that you can skip forward and back when edge is focused (use selenium for python)
- Python GUI (In progress)
- Make toggle gui opaque (python most likely)
- OPTIMIZATION/Clean-Up

# ReBind GUI (Python)
