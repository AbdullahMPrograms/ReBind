# ReBind Beta

CURRENT ISSUES:
- CurrentProgramIndex sets the first program in array as active, therefore youtube doesnt receive keybinds untill it is toggled when stremio is opened
- debugging possible update CurrentProgramIndex before control focus and control send in SendKey

TO DO LATER:
- Make it so that you can send youtube hotkeys even when youtube is not the focused tab
- Make it so that you can skip forward and back when edge is focused
- Universal Audio Keybinds
